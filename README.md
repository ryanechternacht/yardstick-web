# yardstick-web

Yardstick was an EdTech product a friend and I worked on for awhile. We ended up running a lot of Figma wireframes as well as the self-contained mode (see below) by users, and couldn't find anything that felt like a viable business. 

## Build Setup

This is intended to work with the yardstick-api, but I also wrote a self-contained mode that uses static data so my co-founder could play with it and show it as a demo. 

install brew and npm https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:4000 using a static self-contained dataset
$ npm run dev-static
```
